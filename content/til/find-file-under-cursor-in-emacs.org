=#TIL= you can use =gf= to open a file under the current cursor position in VIM, I was reading this [[https://thevaluable.dev/vim-advanced/][post]] I found in Hacker News and I was wondering if =evil-mode= has this functionality as well

=evil-mode= has this key binding defined and it uses =(find-file-at-point)=, it works well for absolute paths but not for relative paths and I wanted to use it for a path like this =templates/home.html= so I wrote some =elisp= code to be able to make what I want:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun my/find-file-under-cursor ()
  "Check it the filepath under cursor is an absolute path otherwise open helm and insert the filepath."
  (interactive)
  (let ((file-path (thing-at-point 'filename t)))
    (if (file-name-absolute-p file-path)
	(find-file-at-point file-path)
      (setq my/text-to-be-inserted-in-minibuffer file-path)
      (helm-ls-git-ls))))
#+end_src

If the path under the cursor is an absolute path it will use the regular =find-file-at-point= function, otherwise it will open =helm-ls-git-ls= and insert that value into the minibuffer. I use the variable =text-to-be-inserted-in-minibuffer= as a "hack" to be able to insert something after helm is opened.

The following code does the magic:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar my/text-to-be-inserted-in-minibuffer nil)

(defun my/insert-text-to-minibuffer ()
  "Insert the text from `my/text-to-be-inserted-in-minibuffer' into the minibuffer after it opened."
  (when my/text-to-be-inserted-in-minibuffer
    (insert my/text-to-be-inserted-in-minibuffer)
    (setq my/text-to-be-inserted-in-minibuffer nil)))

(add-hook 'minibuffer-setup-hook 'my/insert-text-to-minibuffer)
#+end_src

This basically check if =my/text-to-be-inserted-in-minibuffer= has a value different than =nil= and then insert it after =minibuffer-setup-hook= is triggered.

With all of this done we just need to replace the regular behaviour of =gf= with our custom function:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(define-key evil-normal-state-map "gf" 'my/find-file-under-cursor)
#+end_src

And that's it. Enjoy! ðŸŽ‰
