=#TIL= it is possible to create memes in emacs using [[https://github.com/larsmagne/meme][meme]], this package allow to choose an image and add some text to it, we can also select any image and use it.

* Installation

This package, at the time of writing this, is not available on melpa so we have to install it manually or using [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]] or [[https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa][quelpa]], because I'm using =straight.el= for my config we'll use that.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package imgur
  :ensure t
  :straight (imgur
	     :type git
	     :host github
	     :repo "myuhe/imgur.el"))

(use-package meme
  :ensure t
  :straight (meme
	     :type git
	     :host github
	     :repo "larsmagne/meme"))
#+end_src

=meme= require =imgur= as a dependency so we need to install it before.

=straight.el= compiles all the installed packages and load them from a different folder so we won't have the base images in the correct folder, we can copy them with:

#+begin_src shell
cp -r ~/.emacs.d/straight/repos/meme/images ~/.emacs.d/straight/build/meme
#+end_src

The meme generator is based on the SVG support that emacs provides, you can check is your emacs installation has it with:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(image-type-available-p 'svg)
#+end_src

If it returns =t= you're ready to go.

* Usage

Now we can run =M-x meme= and we can choose a base image:

#+CAPTION: Pick meme
#+NAME: fig:pick-meme
[[file:/images/til/meme-generator-in-emacs/pick-meme.png]]

And then we can and add some text to it, like the image below:

#+CAPTION: Adding text
#+NAME: fig:adding-text
[[file:/images/til/meme-generator-in-emacs/edit-text.png]]

Enjoy! ðŸŽ‰
