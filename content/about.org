Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Erick Navarro, software developer.

I've worked mostly doing web development using Python and Javascript but now I work using Elixir also doing web. I'm very interesting in functional programming and that's why I spend time learning cool tech like Haskell and Clojure.

I'm a emacs lover and that made me spend many hours tuning my emacs conf (I regret nothing).
