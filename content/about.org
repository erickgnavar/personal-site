Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Erick Navarro, software developer (a.k.a bugs creator).

I've worked mostly doing web development using Python but now I work using Elixir also doing web. I'm very interesting in functional programming and that's why I spend time learning cool tech like Haskell and Clojure.

I'm a emacs lover and that made me spend many hours tuning my emacs config (I regret nothing).

You can follow me on [[https://twitter.com/erickgnavar][Twitter]], [[https://github.com/erickgnavar][GitHub]] and now also on [[https://twitch.tv/erickgnavar][Twitch]] where I stream about programming stuff in Spanish.
