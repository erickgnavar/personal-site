[[https://mermaid.js.org][Mermaid.js]] is a great tool to make diagrams in plain text, I use it a lot and I wanted to have a way to see previews of the code I was writing.
There are some options to do that but they require to have a [[https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli][mermaid-cli]] installed, which requires ~nodejs~ as well.

Emacs has a built-in webkit browser, in case it was compiled with ~--with-xwidgets~ flag, and mermaid run on js so it should be possible to just run the code I want in the browser and see it there.

This function makes the magic, it just take a region previously selected, which have the mermaid code, create a temp file and write some ~HTML~ there(including our mermaid code).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun my/preview-mermaid ()
  "Render region inside a webit embebed browser."
  (interactive)
  (unless (region-active-p)
    (user-error "Select a region first"))
  (let* ((path (concat (make-temp-file (temporary-file-directory)) ".html"))
         (mermaid-code (buffer-substring-no-properties (region-beginning) (region-end))))
    (save-excursion
      (with-temp-buffer
        (insert "<body>
  <pre class=\"mermaid\">")
        (insert mermaid-code)
        ;; js script copied from mermaid documentation
        (insert "</pre>
  <script type=\"module\">
    import mermaid from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid@10/dist/mermaid.esm.min.mjs';
    mermaid.initialize({ startOnLoad: true });
  </script>
</body>")
        (write-file path)))
    (xwidget-webkit-browse-url (format "file://%s" path))))
#+end_src
