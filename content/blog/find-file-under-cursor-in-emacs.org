=#TIL= you can use =gf= to open a file under the current cursor position in VIM, I was reading this [[https://thevaluable.dev/vim-advanced/][post]] I found in Hacker News and I was wondering if =evil-mode= has this functionality as well

=evil-mode= has this key binding defined and it uses =(find-file-at-point)=, it works well for absolute paths but not for relative paths and I wanted to use it for a path like this =templates/home.html= so I wrote some =elisp= code to be able to make what I want:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun my/find-file-under-cursor ()
  "Check it the filepath under cursor is an absolute path otherwise open helm and insert the filepath."
  (interactive)
  (let ((file-path (thing-at-point 'filename t)))
    (if (file-name-absolute-p file-path)
	(find-file-at-point file-path)
      (minibuffer-with-setup-hook (lambda ()
				    (insert file-path))
	(helm-ls-git-ls)))))
#+end_src

If the path under the cursor is an absolute path it will use the regular =find-file-at-point= function, otherwise it will open =helm-ls-git-ls= and insert that value into the minibuffer. I use =minibuffer-with-setup-hook= to setup a temporal function attached to =minibuffer-setup-hook= to be able to insert the file path in the minibuffer after =helm-ls-git-ls= is opened.

With all of this done we just need to replace the regular behaviour of =gf= with our custom function:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(define-key evil-normal-state-map "gf" 'my/find-file-under-cursor)
#+end_src

And that's it. Enjoy! ðŸŽ‰
